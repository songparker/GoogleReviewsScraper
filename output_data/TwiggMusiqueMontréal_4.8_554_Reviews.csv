1,Shaky J,5,2023-06-22,"Excellent customer service, reasonable speed with the shipping. I could have gotten slightly cheaper shipping elsewhere but I purchased here because of the service. The gentleman in classical guitars took the time to test the case I wanted to purchase, made sure it was a good fit and that it was the correct model number for the order. Happy customer here.",None
2,Magnus Charette,5,2023-03-08,"I had the pleasure of getting my 7 year old yanagisawa alto fully overhauled by Mike, one of Twigg’s repair specialists. The quality of the work was nothing short of fantastic, and the horn was nearly unrecognizable from what I had dropped off. Having recently played a brand new floor model of my horn, I can confidently say that the overhaul work produced an eminently better instrument than what comes new, directly from the factory. Not only was the quality of the work outstanding, but the service in store was marvellous, with the technicians taking lots of time to talk to me and articulate any challenges or issues with my specific instrument, as well as answer any questions and concerns I had. All staff were courteous and welcoming, and were very flexible with helping me to get my horn repaired in a timeframe that fit my schedule. I don’t believe there’s a better repair and retail store in Canada when it comes to wind instruments and professional quality servicing!","Wow, thank you so much for this amazing review ! We appreciate it ! 
Thank you for your trust with your instrument. Please feel free to contact us if you need anything !"
3,Ron Hornsby,5,2022-07-06,"Incredible customer service.. Pascal (Twigg) spent a week or more and a hundred emails with me to discuss my desire to re-turn/re-learn the trombone.  He had incredible patience and knowledge in helping me come to a comfortable and confident decision.  I had looked into Long and Mcquade, but they neglected to even return multiple emails, obviously didn't care (sent by website and direct email address) about gaining my trust or future business.  Thank you very much to the Twigg family for fostering a welcoming feel and such an amazing experience buying my dream trombone, the Conn 88h.  I will be back, and if all my future experiences with Twigg are this way, I'm a customer for life as well as anyone I know inquiring into a first rate trustworthy music store.","Wow ! Thank you so much for this review, we highly appreciate it ! You are more than welcome ! Always a pleasure to help !"

6,Jules Bérubé-Ciotola,3,2022-12-08,"They did a great work restoring my trumpet. It did take a very long time and they forgot to call me for several important updates. The fees were, in my novice opinion, atrocious. I do want to mention the staff there were all very nice. One of them offered to play the trumpet to make sure it sounded just and then proceeded to readjust the pistons on it. He then explained how to clean it and how to lube the pistons. The review might change later on when I am more educated on repair processes.","Bonjour, Notre culture d'entreprise est de s'approcher de la perfection!!!

15,Otoniel Araica,5,2022-07-06,"I bought my first trumpet! Thanks Pascal, you were very informative and answered all of my concerns with no hesitation.

I had the impression that It would take years to get to blow a note that's in tune: but he really motivated me to pursue this through his little bits of advice he gave.

I recommend this place if you want to buy a trumpet or anything else.

17,Emma Radcliffe,5,2019-07-07,"They are the most amazing instrument store ever! Twigg is a store that is filled with music lovers and experts. They truly know everything there is to know about ALL instruments and their accessories. I bought my third instrument from them today. I told them my budget, what sound I'm looking for, what caliber I wanted etc. They know exactly what to let you try based on your description. When you try instruments at the store, they always check up to be sure you have everything you need or if they found another possible option that you may enjoy. Customer service is fantastic. Everyone is super friendly and they truly want what is best for you. They really want to make their customers happy and as a customers of five years, I truly enjoy that and trust them. I know that my instruments are always in good hands when they need a bit of a tune up or need to be cleaned. I trust them a hundred percent. Twigg does not cut corners, they are dedicated and very passionate in their work. Once you go, you will never go anywhere else. The service here is like no other. I love Twigg :)",None

Every time I pick up my instrument I'm reminded of how careful their staff was in making sure I was making the right choice! For the last 4 years I've absolutely adored playing on this horn! I could not recommend a better store for brass players!!!! Thank you guys so much!,"Hi Christina !

29,petey C,5,2019-07-07,"My horn got a couple nasty dents in it this week, including in a particularly hard to reach spot. I called Twigg because I KNEW that if anyone could fix it, they could and I could trust that they'd do a good job. I've taken my old horn to them a couple times before but this was the first time in two years of having it that I've damaged my current one, and I needed it before leaving Montréal at the end of the week. I was actually kind of glad it happened here instead of after I was out of town. Sure enough, my horn looks as good as new, and their price was more than reasonable. These guys know what they're doing and they're the nicest people too. Not to mention they're great supporters of the music community in Mtl, I've seen them at all kinds of places and events, schools, concerts, masterclasses ...they also sell my fav kind of rotor oil, which is a bonus for me :P","Thank you very much for the nice comment!!

32,Craig Horan,1,2016-07-07,"I took my guitar into the shop to have some minor fixes put on it, including the installation of a pre-amp that was supposedly going to take 2 weeks to cover. The service has been friendly, but it's now been over a month and I haven't heard a response from them concerning the status of my repair. I called in but had only received a vague response stating that ""the guitar isn't finished yet."" Luckily the guitar is my second instrument to the piano, but if I were a gigging musician relying on my guitar this would be completely unacceptable! The receipt states that I dropped off the guitar on March 10th 2016, it's now April 11th 2016 with no prospect of the return of my instrument in sight...",None
